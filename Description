# WeightWorkout
Major Project Assignment:  
The users of the software are people who are trying to figure out their ideal weight. The purpose of this software is to provide the user with a multitude of workouts that can help them lose weight. This software will be used at gyms and used when people are new to the gym and do not know what workouts they can do to benefit their weight loss. The software works by the user inputting their weight, then inputting their desired weight. From there, there will be a variety of workouts based on the different parts of your body you want to work on. Such as workouts dedicated to losing arm fat, and workouts that help lose lower stomach fat. This software should be used over the existing processes as most software does not provide accurate descriptions of how to do each workout, therefore it is friendly to those new at gyms.
